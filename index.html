      <p>Hi! This is Ankit Kumar Thakur. I am a resident of New Delhi, India. I had graduated in Mechatronics discipline in 2017 but I have been teaching mathematics since my first year of college.I liked teaching mathematics so much that after
        graduation I made it my career. I have taught in various well known local institutes or academy.After sometime I took up the role of Subject Matter Expert(Maths) at Bytedance Technology India Pvt. Ltd. After sometime I took  up a new role as
        Academic Mentor at Extramarkds Education Pvt. Ltd. My role is basically here is to cater all the queries of the students and keep them engaged in extramarks learning and creating content of maths for their learing requirement. Be it question
        paerp, assignment, homework or tests.Now after this mundane task started to getting on my nerve and will push me to lowest or negative phase of my life ever, I have decided to change my career path once and for all. I have decided that I will
        become a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Blockchain Developer</strong> in less than 3 months and start freelancing gigs and get a remote job as soon as possible. There are many reaons to do so. Reason 1: To have high demand
        skill for now and future, Reason 2:
        To have a stability of high income for me and my family, Reason 3: To have a statble and fullfilling career , Reason 4: To pay off all my debts and start long pending businesses,Reason 5: To Buy a house for my family, Reason 6: To give my
        siblings freedome from their jobs so that they can focus and devote their time completely to their studies and career and learning new skills to become future ready like me,Reason 7: To make my mother proud of her son and give her wings to fly
        high in the sky and make her completely independent of us so that in case in future of anyone of us leaves mother's hand in the middle , she would be able to take care of herself, and come out as strongest woman we have ever known. </p></td>
